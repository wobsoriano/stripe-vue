Rename package to `vue-stripe`

This major release marks the transition to the `vue-stripe` package name, graciously transferred by [@matfish2](https://github.com/matfish2), the original maintainer of the [Vue 2 vue-stripe](https://github.com/matfish2/vue-stripe) library. This project aims to deliver a comprehensive 1:1 equivalent to the [React Stripe SDK](https://github.com/stripe/react-stripe-js) with complete tests.
