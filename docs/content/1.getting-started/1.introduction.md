## Introduction

Vue Stripe is a comprehensive Vue wrapper for Stripe.js and Stripe Elements. It provides a seamless way to integrate secure payment collection into your Vue applications.

## What is Stipe Vue?

Vue Stripe is designed as a 1:1 equivalent to the React Stripe SDK, bringing the same powerful features and DX to the Vue ecosystem. It provides intuitive composables and components that feel natural in Vue applications.

The library is a thin wrapper around Stripe Elements, allowing you to add secure payment forms to any Vue app while maintaining full customization control over styling and behavior.
